subjects

	The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years.
	The subjects are number 1 - 30.	
	Value is categorical

activities

	eacach person performed six activities while wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.
	Value is categorical with each value having the following labels:
	
		1. WALKING
		2. WALKING_UPSTAIRS
		3. WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
		4. SITTING
		5. STANDING
		6. LAYING

561- continuous measurements were gathered - some as time and some as frequency.  66 of those based on mean or standard deviation are in the data set.
Mean was taken for each measurement by each subject performing each activity to produce a 180 rows of 66 measurements
